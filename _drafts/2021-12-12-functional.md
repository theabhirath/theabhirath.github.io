Everyone hears of functional programming these days. It's everywhere in new software; it's the hot new feature even in legacy languages like Java, and support for it is one of the reasons why JavaScript and Python are considered amongst the most flexible languages to program with today. But what _is_ functional programming, and why is it so popular right now? 

That's what I want to try and explain in this article, starting by taking a look at the overarching paradigm functional programming falls under -- **declarative programming** -- before peeking under the hood of functional programming and trying to understand what about it is so powerful. Let's dive right in!

It's probably helpful to read my previous article on the [imperative programming paradigm](_posts/2021-04-31-imperative.md) before this one if you're unfamiliar with terms like "programming paradigm".

While imperative programming revolves around specifying the exact way in which a program will execute, declarative programming is a paradigm that is based on expressing the logic for the computation required to be performed without describing its control flow. There are a lot of _almost_ equivalent definitions for declarative programming -- you will ofte
