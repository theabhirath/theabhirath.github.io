I‚Äôm a sophomore student pursuing my B.E. in Computer Science at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani, Pilani. My main research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and especially deep learning with the medical domain. I have dabbled a bit with medical imaging and hope to branch out into more diverse fields in machine learning for medical applications.

I am especially passionate about the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/) and its ecosystem and have made several open-source contributions to its deep learning framework, [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) and the surrounding ecosystem. I am a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) contributor under NumFOCUS, where I am working on improving the Julia ecosystem for deep learning in computer vision.

When I'm not programming, I play chess or cricket. I watch cricket, tennis, football, hockey, Formula 1...the list goes onüòÅ. I'm an avid reader and occasionally dabble in writing as well.
