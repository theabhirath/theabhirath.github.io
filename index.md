I am a third year student pursuing my B.E. in Computer Science at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani, Pilani. My main research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and especially deep learning with biology and medicine. I have worked primarily in computer vision before, although I am interested in other applications of machine learning as well. I am also exploring the theory of deep learning and efficient neural network architectures, as well as deep learning systems and the underlying infrastructure.

I am especially passionate about the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/) and its ecosystem and have made several open-source contributions to its deep learning framework, [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) and the surrounding ecosystem. I am one of the maintainers of the [Metalhead.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Metalhead.jl) library, which helps users to work with deep learning for computer vision. Previously I was a **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** contributor under NumFOCUS, where I worked on improving the Julia ecosystem for deep learning in computer vision. Know more about my work [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1igo5LbqWqdUFNKUrK9VngLQSbLYz9jTl/view?usp=sharing).

When I'm not programming, I play chess, cricket or badminton. I love to watch sports, and watch cricket, tennis, football, hockey, Formula 1...the list goes onüòÅ. I'm an avid reader and occasionally dabble in writing as well.
